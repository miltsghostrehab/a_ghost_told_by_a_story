# a_ghost_told_by_a_story
NaNoGenMo 2020 - You watch a computer write a novel for you, and then at the end you have a novel.

The game pulls from the following 4 existing novels, currently available on The Gutenberg Project:
+ [Jane Eyre: An Autobiography by Charlotte BrontÃ«](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1260)
+ [The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43)
+ [Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84)
+ [Anthem by Ayn Rand](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1250)

_I have not chosen these for any particular reason; I don't think I've even read any of them. The resulting combination seems to create novels with a kind of...sexuality though._

## OBJECT OF THE GAME/GAME DESCRIPTION
>You are a writer. Well, you want to be a writer. Or, that is you want to be known as a writer...without actually writing anything. The ghostly computer program  known as Joss wants to help. They will generate lines and paragraphs ~~using~~ inspired by the works of classic authors. Every once in a while, you are allowed a choice between two potential paragraphs; then watch as Joss creates a "masterpiece" in your name. Watch in wonder as Joss creates each line, paragraph, chapter and even your pen-name!
